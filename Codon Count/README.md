## Overview
The CodonCount project is a Java application designed to analyze DNA sequences and provide insights into the frequency of specific codons across different reading frames. A codon is a sequence of three DNA bases (A, T, C, G) that corresponds to a specific amino acid in protein synthesis. This project allows users to input DNA sequences and obtain detailed statistics about the occurrence of each codon, helping in the study of genetic codes and protein synthesis.

## Features
- **Codon Analysis:** Calculates the frequency of each codon in a given DNA sequence.
- **Reading Frame Support:** Supports analysis in three different reading frames, providing comprehensive insights into codon usage.
- **Customizable Count Ranges:** Users can specify count ranges to filter the codons of interest based on their frequency.
- **Most Common Codon Identification:** Identifies the most frequently occurring codon within the DNA sequence.
