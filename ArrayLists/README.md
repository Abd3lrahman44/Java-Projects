## Description

This project comprises Java programs aimed at conducting textual analysis through various metrics. These tools are designed to provide insights into the frequency of word usage and character involvement in script plays, offering valuable resources for both educational purposes and literary analysis. The suite is particularly beneficial for students, researchers, and hobbyists interested in understanding the nuances of language use in written texts.

## Features

### WordFrequencies

The `WordFrequencies` component is a sophisticated tool that scans text documents to determine the prevalence of each word. It meticulously identifies unique words across the text and quantifies their occurrences, providing a detailed breakdown of word usage. This analysis can reveal patterns in language use, such as common words or phrases, and can be particularly insightful for linguistic research or literary critique.

### CharactersInPlay

The `CharactersInPlay` component delves into the world of plays, analyzing scripts to catalogue the cast of characters and quantify their contributions. By examining lines of dialogue, this tool identifies characters and counts their spoken parts, offering an overview of character prominence and engagement throughout the play. It includes functionality to filter characters based on the number of lines they have, allowing for a focused analysis on major or minor characters.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development, testing, and exploration purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java SE Development Kit (JDK) - This project was developed using Java, so you'll need the JDK installed to compile and run the programs.
- [edu.duke package](http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/course2/doc/javadoc/index.html) - A specialized Java library provided by Duke University, designed to support educational projects and simplify file operations.

2. Configure your Java project to recognize the `edu.duke` package. This may involve adding the library to your project's classpath or configuring it within your IDE.

3. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and ensure it builds correctly.

## Usage

### WordFrequencies

To initiate a word frequency analysis:

1. Execute the `WordFrequencies` program.
2. Select a text file for analysis when prompted by the program.
3. The output will list each unique word found in the text, alongside the number of times it appears, providing a comprehensive view of word frequency within the document.

### CharactersInPlay

To analyze character involvement in a play:

1. Launch the `CharactersInPlay` program.
2. Choose a script file containing the play you wish to analyze.
3. The program will output a list of characters along with their line counts, highlighting both primary and secondary characters based on their dialogue contributions. Additionally, you can utilize the filtering feature to examine characters within specific ranges of spoken lines.
